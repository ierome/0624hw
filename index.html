        <h3>Story Behind Stunting for Myself.</h3>
        <p>I started stunting about a year ago or so, been riding bikes for close to 8 years off and on. I have always enjoyed stunting because of the thrill.</p>
        <p>I have crashed and fell plenty of times but the trick is to just keep on going. It's the name of the game.</p>
        I plan on to continue to practice until I get down circles and then maybe put it up <br>
        That is my goal.
